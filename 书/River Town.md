# River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze

## Notes

##### I'm really curious how an "outsider" feels and identifies his life in a small town in China in 90s trying to understand and get in with all the potential cuture shock. It's also a good opportunity for me to look into who we used to be and who we are now.

Quote: It struck me as a particlarly appropriate way to honor the history of Chinese Communism, to march a thousand miles and end up bankrupt in Yan'an.

Note: I can easily imagine what the expression will be on the writer's face upon learning this : ) I guess when a nation's history is long enough involving lots of wars, disasters, gaining pain first to earn happiness, it's easier to put up with this kind of suffering and absurdness. But honestly, something that would happen in 90s or even today also looks bizzard to me.

Quote: Drifted up tp my apartment in the mornings —— the gentle knock of the ball, the sound of shuffled footsteps on had dirt, the soft chatter and laughter of the retirees as they played without hurry. These were some of the most soothing sounds I had ever heard, and often I sat out on my balcony and simply listened, the croquet sounds backed by the unsteady hum of the cicadas and the noise of the Wu River. Boat horns echoed across the narrow river valley, and motors sputtered against the current, and barges clanked as they unloaded sand onto rumbling trucks at the water's edge. A mile from my apartment, the Wu died in the brown rush of the Yangtze, and often I could hear a lonely horn ooming out from the big river.



Note: 人间烟火气，美。The best part of my staying at this cityview hotel room is its sofa by the window with a small table on it. I just brew coffee, hold my kindle,  open my laptop playing random music, and watch out the view and passengers on the street from the window. While I do prefer natural noise from rains or birds to those mentioned in the book : p I always know I'd have window seats once I have my own home. Read, blank out, play video games, or just look out of the window there.
