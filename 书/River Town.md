# River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze

## Notes

##### I'm really curious how an "outsider" feels and identifies his life in a small town in China in 90s trying to understand and get in with all the potential cuture shock. It's also a good opportunity for me to look into who we used to be and who we are now.

Quote: It struck me as a particlarly appropriate way to honor the history of Chinese Communism, to march a thousand miles and end up bankrupt in Yan'an.

Note: I can easily imagine what the expression will be on the writer's face upon learning this : ) I guess when a nation's history is long enough involving lots of wars, disasters, gaining pain first to earn happiness, it's easier to put up with this kind of suffering and absurdness. But honestly, something that would happen in 90s or even today also looks bizzarre to me.

Quote: Drifted up tp my apartment in the mornings —— the gentle knock of the ball, the sound of shuffled footsteps on had dirt, the soft chatter and laughter of the retirees as they played without hurry. These were some of the most soothing sounds I had ever heard, and often I sat out on my balcony and simply listened, the croquet sounds backed by the unsteady hum of the cicadas and the noise of the Wu River. Boat horns echoed across the narrow river valley, and motors sputtered against the current, and barges clanked as they unloaded sand onto rumbling trucks at the water's edge. A mile from my apartment, the Wu died in the brown rush of the Yangtze, and often I could hear a lonely horn ooming out from the big river.



Note: 人间烟火气，美。The best part of my staying at this cityview hotel room is its sofa by the window with a small table on it. I just brew coffee, hold my kindle,  open my laptop playing random music, and watch out the view and passengers on the street from the window. While I do prefer natural noise from rains or birds to those mentioned in the book : p I always know I'd have window seats once I have my own home. Read, blank out, play video games, or just look out the window there.

Quote: I didn't really understand any of the routines. I didn't know where the boats were going and I didn't know why the college was regulated the way it was. They played croquet differently than we do in America, but I never bothered to figure out the Fuling rules. I simply liked their playing every day —— the regularity was what mattered.



Quote: The first thing I saw was myself and Adam. This was intimidating, because never in my life had I been watched so closely that every action was replayed and evaluated. Everything we did was talked and written about; every quirk or habit was laid bare. Students wrote about the way I always carried a water bottle to class; they wrote about how I placed the classroom as I taught; they wrote about my laugh, which they found ridiculous. They wrote about my foreign nose, which impresssed them as impossibly long and straight, and many of them wrote about my blue eyes. This was perhaps the strangest detail of all, because my eyes are hazel —— but my students had read that foreigners had blue eyes, and they saw what they wanted to see.

Quote: Nevertheless, Reform and Opening resulted in massive social changes, ranging from increased mobility between regions to new styles and attitudes that were influenced by foreign cultures. Most Chinese people saw these as positive developments, because they were accomplished by rising living standards, but there were still quiet fears that lurked in people's minds. And simply having the first American teachers in Fuling was enought to trigger these uncertainties.
