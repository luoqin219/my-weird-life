# Harvard: Positive Psychology

Went through part of these lectures when I was still an undergrad and it was about 6 or 5 years ago. And after all these years, I still give WOWs and smiles when watching these : )

## What is positive psychology

### Fun notes

1. Interviewers tend to expect the professor of positive psychology to be more outgoing and less introvertive since the reason why positive psychology is much more popular than introduction to economics at Harvard is likely to be the teacher is outgoing, extremely charismatic, very cheerful and extrovert. (Looking at the messager instead of the message => **science that works not just study**)

2. Words are not the sole medium of exchange in teaching and learning. We educate with silence as well. Silence gives us a chance to reflect on what we have said and heard. In authentic education, silence is treated as a trustworthy matrix for the inner work students must do, a medium for learning of the deepest sort.

### Background

#### The third force - said lacked rigorous methodology

1. First force: behaviorism

2. Second force: psychoanalysis

3. Third force: humanistic psychology -> a reaction to the above 2 forces

#### Salutogenesis - alternative model to the conventional model of pathologies

1. Saluto -> health

2. Genes -> origin

#### Why and what

1. science that works not just study

2. a network of scholars who will focus on love, relationships, self-esteem, motivation, resilience and well-being

### Class Notes

1. Not just information but also transformation -> change the shape of the form

2. It's about chipping away the excess stone. It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers, whether it's the fear of failure, something that we didn't have as kids. But today most people in our culture have it. It's about chipping away perfectionism that is deblitating and often hurts us. It's about chipping away our ability for success, because maybe we are afraid of success. Maybe we feel guity about some of the things that we have in our life, and that in turn limits us. Maybe it's about chipping away the limitations on our relationships in while we don't thrive within them. 

3. The importance of gratitude, the importance of physical exercise, the importance of spending time on our relationships, and the importance of taking time aside and simplifying. There is no WOW. A good life, a fulfilling life, a rich life includes ups and downs, includes pain and getting up again, includes failure and getting up again. It includes success and celebrating it. Victories and losses, ups and downs. It's not about one secret. Yes, a lot of it is commen sense. The aim of this class is to make common sense more common, especially in the real-world application. 

4. Two and two things along mattered in terms of determining who will be the extraordinary successful and successful: the first thing was the extraordinarily successful groups really believe in themselves. They thought they could do well. They were driven. They were motivated. They thought "I'm going to make it. I'm going to succeed." - **the sense of the confidence**. The second thing that he found was this group were always asking questions, intially of their boss, later of their employees, of their partners, children, parents, friends. They were always at the state of curiosity. Always looking up, opening up, wanting to understand the world more. **They were life-long learners**. 

5. What is most personal is most general.

6. **When we understand ourselves better, when we identify ourselves, we are better able to identify with others.** In fact, this is in many ways the source of empathy, of the healthy empathy. And there are studies showing people who know themselves, who study themselves, who are self-reflective, display less egregious behavior, less immoral behavior towards others. Because when we see our deep nature, what we encounter there is part of the universal nature, the similarities among us all, regardless of where we are from. 

7. The simplicity on the other side of complexity - the simplicity that comes after we have chewed the idea, after we have digested it, after we have thought about it. Ideas that have been worked on. And if on the other side of complexity we can read simplcity and common sense, that's great.

8. "On Monday I don't want you to call me up and tell me how wonderful it was. On Monday, **I want you to call me up and tell me what you're doing differently**." More importantly, it's how you're doing differently, how this has an impact on your life and that takes effort. **Because it is so difficult to change**. Because we know most organizational change fails, because we know most individual change fails. Unless we introduce behavioral change along with our cognitive and emotional change. Affect and cognition is not enough; behavior has to be there as well. **To do things differently very often takes courage**. 

## Why study positive psychology

Question: Why not just study happiness? Or well-being as part of social psychology?

Stats: From 1967 to 2000, over 5000 research articles on anger, over 41000 research articles on anxiety, over 54000 articles on depression. Research on joy, 415 studies. Close to 2000 on happiness in 33 years. Life satisfaction came on top of 2500 studies. Ratio is about 21:1.

Reseacher thoughts: It has revealed to us much about man's shortcomings but little about his petentialities, his virtues, his achievable aspirations or his psychological height. It is as if psychologt had voluntarily restricted itself to only half its rightful jurisdiction and that darker, meaner half.

***Highlight***: The aim of positive psychologt is to **catalyze a change** in psychology from a preoccupation only with *repairing the worst things* in life to also **building the best qualities in life**.

### Class Notes

1. Being happy is not just the negation of happiness. It doesn't mean just get rid of depression or anxiety that I'm experiencing. I spontaneously become happy. That's not the case. That's not how it works. And finally, prevention which is very important today, the most effective way of preventing hardship, whether it's depression, whether it's anxiety, is actually by **focusing on and cultivating the positive**. 

2. **Resilience** - a class of phenomena characterized by patterns of positive adaptation in the context of significant adversity or risk. (Successful kids are not super or extraordinary kids. In fact these were ordinary kids with ordinary characteristics, that led to extraordinary results.）

3. **Optimisitic** but not in the detached Pollyannish sense, in that they believe in things that would work out well. **Optimisitic as an interpretation style**. Optimisitic in the sense of thinking "*<u>well, it may not work well this time. It will work out later. I have learned from what had just happened</u>*." (*Note: huh this is so me*) They had faith and sense of meaning in life. It was doing something that they really believed in. Many of them were idealistic. (*Note: huh AGAIN this is so me*). **TO BE IDEALISTIC IS TO BE REALISTIC**. Because we have a real internal need, innate need for idealism. 

4. Pro-social behavior, helping other people, shifting from helplessness to helpfulness, they were significant. We enter an upward spiral between self-help and other-help. Because when we help others, we are helping ourselves. When we help ourselves, we are helping others. 

5. Identify your strength. Set goals, be future-oriented, not just thinking about how bad things are today perhaps, but also think about "this is where I wanna be 5 years or 10 years from now." Have a role model. And finally, most significantly, do not bowl alone - have social support. Do not say "well, I am tough enough to do it by myself." Rather say "I'm tough enough to reach out for help." - the strength to admit weaknesses as well. The strength to admit a need.

6. The important thing about social support is **identifying the right people**. People who, when you reach out to them, will reach back to you and will be able to give back.

7. "We see what we look for and we miss much of what we are not looking for even though it is there. Our experience of the world is heavily influenced by where we place our attention."

8. 《Marva Collins' Way》- a book for people wanting to be teachers, leaders and parents.

9. Passive victim -> active agent: I take action, I take responsibility, I go on to places after experiencing the pain (giving ourselves the permission to be human). Self-perception theory: action will increase our level of confidence, and then more hope and optimisim is a result, and they become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

10. No one is coming. You are responsible for your life, for your self-confidence, for your self-esteem, for your happiness.

### Personal Notes

1. Going through some of the content is like look back what I have done and gradually grown into and suddenly realize how my personal life falls under positive psychology perfectly. Well, I probably learnt these in a hard way but kids who have not experienced enough may not be able to extract all the essense. Good things deserve repetitive visits.

2. About social support on identifying the right people: I think that's why I'm always picky at people connections and trying to cultivate better connections if I have no choice in some cases. We can be impacted hugely by people around, so if we want to better and grow ourselves in an easier/happier way, get the people who not only love you but also know how to love you in a way that best suits you, meaning that they mostly understand what you need, what you truly want, and what will make you happy. It's hard - it requires maturity, empathy, knowledge, even intelligence and some luck. The way I think of to be responsible for my own life is to make cautious choices when it comes to letting someone really step into my life and letting someone go if we are not easily happy together. Basically find the right connection instead of cultivating it from scratch especially when we are already grown-ups. People can always naturally find their perfectly matched groups - if there's too much drama or torture, I think it means people involved could all have done better/wiser. Willingness to grow and growth pace might be the most important factors for me to identify whether it's "right".

3. TODO: think more about to be idealistic is to be realistic

## Is happiness a random phenomenon?

Q: Running away from painful experiences or actively seeking pleasure? Running away from unhappiness or adhering to the declaration of independence and pursuing happiness?

### Disease Model vs Health Model

**Disease model**: The optimum level is the zero: let's just be OK; let's just not hurt.

**Health model**: That's not enough; let's go beyond that; let's go to excitement, to the fun. Because the ideal is not just a tensionless state. It's the creative tension. It's flow*.

*Flow: flow is the state where we're excited, where we're engaging what we're doing, where it's much more than being "comfortably numb". In fact, it's being a little bit uncomfortable; it's being outside of our comfort zone; it's being in our stretch zone - not the panic zone, where there's excitement, where there's some nervousness. There's also growth there.

### Class Notes

1. What the world needs, more than anything else, is **practical idealists**. "How can I make the world a better place?"

2. Idealism and good intentions are not enough. That's why we should merge, mate research and practice.

3. How much do genes matter? How much is it about nature versus nurture? Significant similarities among those twins who were apart at birth, had entirely different enviornments, reared in different contries, and they share very similar personalities and their well-being and happiness levels were incredibly similar. -> 《Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon》? no -> level of happiness is not only determined by their genes but also their experiences.

4. Let's not only study what is working, but also **study the best**. Let's study the most successful people, the most successful relationships, and learn from that. <u>If we study our best experiences when we are at our happiest, when we are at our most successful, when we thrive the most within the relationship, we can learn from it and apply it to our future as well</u>. **When we study our average, we are describing our live. When we are studying the best within ourselves, we are potentially prescribing.** If we learn from these experiences in ourselves, the question is no longer whether or not it's possible to experience it more and more in our lives. The question is "<u>how is it possible to experience it</u>".

## Belief as Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

### Premise: Happiness

1. Positive emotions have an evolutionary reason, that they have a purpose beyond just making us feel good. For example, they help us think beyond what we are thinking right now, broaden our thinking; they help us build relationships; they help us build capacities.

2. What happens when we experience negative emotions is that our consciousness, our thinking narrows and constricts. We focus just on one thing. It could be a good thing but I can be in "fight or flight" mode. It's not good to continue narrowing and constricting beyond the threat or the hardship. Very often we enter a downward spiral, a vicious cycle when we go into this narrow and constrict mode. Narrow & Constrict -> Broaden & Build (virtuous cycle) -> create an upward spiral

3. "I want to be happy" sounds selfish? Yes. Well, **equating to selfishness and immorality is the No.1 cause, subconsciously mostly, but not only, No.1 cause of unhappiness. Because people feel guilty about pursuing their own happiness.** People feel guilty at times feeling good about themselves. How can I pursue my happiness when there's so much suffering in the world? Response - First of all, **happiness is a positive sum game**, not a zero sum game, neither a negative sum game. It's not that my happiness takes away from other people's happiness. **Because happiness is contagious**. If I'm happier, I'm more likely to contribute to other people's happiness and wellbeing. Being happy, in other words, is also a moral state in the sense of actually contributing to other people's wellbeing. It's like passing on light. (Note: maybe we should make decisions based on whether it's making ourselves happy first and think of other ways to ensure people around will be happy as well later on instead of taking too many other factors into consideration and losing our own light eventually - that's probably why I was told to try to be more selfish sometime)

4. **"Be the change you want to see in the world." - People mostly do what you do, rather than what you say.** The optimal way of spreading happiness is to work on your own happiness, because then you are leading by example. That applies to leadership and parenting.

### Class Notes

Example: Roger Bannister and the dream mile: there's no human limit on it.

To sum up: Beliefs are self-fulfilling prophecies. Very oftern they determine how we perform. How well or how poorly we perform. They often determine how good or not so good our relationships are. They are the No.1 predictor of life success as well as wellbeing. 

#### How beliefs shape reality

1. Pygmalion story, 《My Fair Lady》, telling teachers a bunch of randomly picked students are their fast spurters  -> people can be changed and can be transformed. (Note: well I think first people have to own that potential, meaning that the beliefs don't come from nowhere or just wishes, and second they have to be self-willing to change/transform as in they think the change/transformation is beneficial to them and they can take the risk/cost. Otherwise, it's still a torture and won't work well)

2. "Asch Conformity Experiment", "The obedience to authority". The power of the situation, obedience to authority. Why don't we create more positive situations instead that will help us lead happier and more moral lives? 1979 to 1959 retreat experiment as if 20 years younger. One week after, both mental and biological age decreased. 

## A positive environment changes people

Realized I somehow skipped this one which is actually expected to be explored before **Belief as Self-Fulfilling Prophecies**.

### Human network as exponential function

"We underestimate our capacity to effect change because we underestimate the growth of an exponential function." - **start small and pay it forward**

### Internal factors vs External factors

Example: tenure -> made it vs rejected

1. External circumstances matter very little. Place of residents makes very little difference as well. Where we are, where we live, income levels, lottery, tenure, getting into our dream college, getting our dream job for you seniors - you'll get a spike in your level of wellbeing when you got this acceptance letter, but very quickly we go back to our base level. **One thing that does matter to our base level of wellbeing which is external circumstance is democracy versus oppression. People living in democracies are generally significantly happier than people living in dictatorships.**

2. In long term, the problem is not lower these high expectations - the problem is **right** versus **wrong** expectations. It is wrong expectation to expect that getting into a certain place, getting a raise, finding our dream partner, is responsible for our happiness. That in and of itself will not make us happier. The right expectation is to believe in change from within. **Our readiness and potential to experience happiness is mostly depended on our state of mind, not on our status, or the states of our bank account. It's about changing our perception - state of mind. It's about changing our interpretation of the world, of what's happening to us, of our achievements, of our failures. It's about what we choose to perceive and what we choose to focus on. It's about transformation.**

### Should we accept human nature or can we perfect it and can it change?

Research by thomas Sowell: divide people into 2 camps: people with constrained vision on human nature versus people with unlimited vision on the same

"live with it but channel flaws to the good" vs "it's perfectable. let's change"

*Lecturer's view*: 

Human nature is fixed. We have inclinations. We have certain instincts that are there and have been formed either God-given or evolutionary-given for millions of years that have been formed. They are not going to change any time soon. Not in our life time. It's fixed. We are stuck with them through good and ill. And all we can do after we accept this nature is to first understand it through research/search/introspection, and then after we understand it, make the best use of it. How can I channel my nature? 

(*Personal Note: 98% agreed. This view will help lead to an easier life and less torture within human connections - do not try to change anyone else. But definitely will be willing to perfect/change myself if I feel necessary.*)

### The permission to be human

Child-rearing: "Over the next few months, you are going to be experiencing every single kind of emotion to the extreme and that's fine. That's natural."

#### Active acceptance

Understand that certain things I cannot change and certain things I can and ought to change. 

#### ABC of psychology

**Affect**: emotion

**Behaviors**: action

**Cogintions**: thoughts

Unconditional acceptance and permission to be human relates primarily to our affect/emotions. That does not mean we need to accept our behavior and our cognition. 

Example from Tal: I can have envy towards my best friend, which in and of itself does not make me a bad person. Envy is part of human nature, nothing good or bad about the envy. Nothing good or bad about experiencing the anger. Nothing good or bad about experiencing the depression or anxiety. However, the question is how do I choose to behave, to act as a result of it? That's where I can have moral or immoral behavior toward my best friend or baby, or other people in general. I can choose to envy my best friend and choose to behave generously and benevolently toward him. The same with cognition. I can feel it certain way but it doesn't mean that I need to resign to my thoughts about that feeling. It's not that helpful to ruminate about painful emotions. It's much helpful to write about them, to talk to other people about them, rather than just thinking about it constantly how miserable I am because my girlfriend just left and I haven't found anyone in Pinocchio's. Rumination doesn't help. **I don't necessarily accept all my irrational thoughts. The key is to be true to reality**.



It's actually a course in **<u>REALITY PSYCHOLOGY</u>**. It's how quickly, how promptly we can recover from these painful emotions. In other words, how strong our psychological immune system is. And our psychological immune system strengthens when we give ourselves the permission to be human.



"God, grant me the serenity to accept things I cannot change; the courage to change the things I can change; and the wisdom to know the difference."
