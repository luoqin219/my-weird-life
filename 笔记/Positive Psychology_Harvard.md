# Harvard: Positive Psychology

Went through part of these lectures when I was still an undergrad and it was about 6 or 5 years ago. And after all these years, I still give WOWs and smiles when watching these : )

## What is positive psychology

### Fun notes

1. Interviewers tend to expect the professor of positive psychology to be more outgoing and less introvertive since the reason why positive psychology is much more popular than introduction to economics at Harvard is likely to be the teacher is outgoing, extremely charismatic, very cheerful and extrovert. (Looking at the massager instead of the message => **science that works not just study**)

2. Words are not the sole medium of exchange in teaching and learning. We educate with silence as well. Silence gives us a chance to reflect on what we have said and heard. In authentic education, silence is treated as a trustworthy matrix for the inner work students must do, a medium for learning of the deepest sort.

### Background

#### The third force - said lacked rigorous methodology

1. First force: behaviorism

2. Second force: psychoanalysis

3. Third force: humanistic psychology -> a reaction to the above 2 forces

#### Salutogenesis - alternative model to the conventional model of pathologies

1. Saluto -> health

2. Genes -> origin

#### Why and what

1. science that works not just study

2. a network of scholars who will focus on love, relationships, self-esteem, motivation, resilience and well-being

### Class Notes

1. Not just information but also transformation -> change the shape of the form

2. It's about chipping away the excess stone. It's about getting rid of limitations, of barriers, whether it's the fear of failure, something that we didn't have as kids. But today most people in our culture have it. It's about chipping away perfectionism that is deblitating and often hurts us. It's about chipping away our ability for success, because maybe we are afraid of success. Maybe we feel guity about some of the things that we have in our life, and that in turn limits us. Maybe it's about chipping away the limitations on our relationships in while we don't thrive within them. 

3. The importance of gratitude, the importance of physical exercise, the importance of spending time on our relationships, and the importance of taking time aside and simplifying. There is no WOW. A good life, a fulfilling life, a rich life includes ups and downs, includes pain and getting up again, includes failure and getting up again. It includes success and celebrating it. Victories and losses, ups and downs. It's not about one secret. Yes, a lot of it is commen sense. The aim of this class is to make common sense more common, especially in the real-world application.
