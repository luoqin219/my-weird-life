# Lighthouse

Per Wikipedia, A lighthouse is a tower, building, or other type of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses and to serve as a beacon for navigational aid, for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways.

Thriving and awesome relations on my mind don't have to be too complicated, or at least I hope it could be something we can easily understand and as simple as being each other's lighthouse.

Be the lighthouse when people you really care about are confused, scared, stressed, struggling, kind of lost facing the storm —— help them better understand themselves, guide them to face and embrace the true feelings, get lessons learnt or problems figured out on their own without too much pain, and then let them make their own decisions from there. Lighthouse is not for pointing out a specific direction. It's there to showcase support and make sure people you care about can gain the strength and options from you to bravely sail alone. It's about letting them do whatever they truly feel like they have to do at the moment without putting any types of pressure on them. 

There's never a perfect answer in life but there could be a perfect answer in short term, solving most problems instantly. While it does not mean that answer will last forever. We've learnt lessons from making choices and also sort of known ourselves clearer along the way. But growth shall never end. If it's not a wonderful result, it's not an ending. It simply means we still have lessons to learn, walls to break, brand-new worlds to see, and dangerous things to explore. 

Lighthouse might not stay close for a while, but it's there shining bright from dusk till dawn. And eventually if it's meant to stay close to a sailor, it will.

作为一个在精神层面极度理想主义的人，我想好的关系应该是不自觉靠近，持久被看见、被理解，在下坠时被托住，遇到问题征求建议、互相尊重、一起面对、一起成长，是克制不住地脱下铠甲做个孩子，是自然而然变回大人的心疼和体贴，是让你做你自己。而这个过程应当是自然而然不必强迫的。当compromise不再是妥协而是成全的时候，当改变习惯不再是痛苦而是勇敢承担风险和自我成长的时候，当沟通不同观点和习惯不再是碰撞而是光明照进不同世界的时候，我想这才是可以在生活的江湖里杀出一条血路的爱情。

生活的柴米油盐或许很难，好的爱情应当是两个人并肩一起快乐地解决层出不穷的问题，携手写下闯关经验，然后挽着手勇敢走向下一个关卡。因为好的关系意味着你们不仅是爱人，更是彼此的好友、战友、老师和幼儿园同班同学。

从短期来看是”我一见你就笑“、”经历过最温柔共振“，长期来看是”情人游天地，日月换行李“，是”与你说些无聊事，再走几千里“。回到理性的说辞，大概是互相吸引的两个成长型人格一起期待未来的共同成长，也可以偶尔偷懒做对小孩。

没想到两年前写过这么好的东西！其实两年后反而没有再这么抽象得思考过亲密关系了，大概年幼的时候根本没有尝试过（笑。我依然认同这些观点，但也认识到关系不只是高屋建瓴得挥斥方遒，更是两个人之间沟壑阴影下的藻荇交横。
这半年工作生活全然是极限挑战模式，burnout后的洞穴期长之又长到现在还没出去，开始越发接受很多事情不仅无趣且做不到自己的理想程度。作为组里第五个向外跑且被扣下拥有2-month transition period的人还在为即将成为ex组的项目发愁。和许多跑在我前面的老大哥认真聊了很多句人生，结论是“compartmentalizing and limiting what we actually care about (at work? at life?) is something we all should work on getting better at.” At end of the day, work is just work.

聊回lighthouse。When you wish you could be someone's lighthouse, you are mostly screwed, in a good way though. When you have someone as your lighthouse, you are the luckiest person in the world.
写到这里的我下意识抬头看了眼显示器上的屏幕挂灯，笑了一下。
